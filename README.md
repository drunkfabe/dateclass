# Date Class
# project overview
This project implements a custom date class without using built-in libraries. It can validate dates (including leap years), calculate the day of the week, find the difference between two dates, update dates, and compare them. The goal is to understand how date logic works internally by building it from scratch.
# additional
Validating leap years properly took some research, especially how leap years work every 4, 100, and 400 years.
Calculating the total number of days from year 1 to the given date (to find the difference between two dates) was also a bit complex
